git-prompt for clink
====================

This is an implementation of the git-prompt.sh script for
[clink](http://code.google.com/p/clink/), bringing a git-aware prompt to the
native cmd.exe shell.

Requirements
------------

A working installation of clink.

Installation
------------

Drop the script into `%HOME%\\clink\\` (typically
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\clink` on a modern Windows system with
English locale).

Warnings
--------

This is a partial implementation and has limited testing. Performance needs
improvement and all the cases have not yet been tested. If you have a problem,
just remove the script from your clink installation and reload with <CTRL-Q>.
